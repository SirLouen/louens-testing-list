# Louen's Testing List for WordPress Core Development

This is a manually curated List of Reports that are ideal for users starting or willing to help testing in the WordPress development ecosystem.

To be in this list I'm taking into account some requirements:
1. It should have a patch.
2. The patch has to be passing in the first review.
3. It should have clear testing instructions.
4. It should not be a trivial patch, like adding a little CSS style or a PHPCS. Not a prerequisite, but as a rule of thumb, ideally, no obvious one-liners that can be reviewed with a simple visual inspection.

The idea of this List is to provide extra testing reports to confirm and trim the hassle of Core Reviewers of having to personally test patches that can potentially be wrong and focus straight on those that are more likely to be ready to be shipped ASAP.

If you want your patch to be in this list, please PM at [Slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/) @ SirLouen
